The code in this folder is used to analyze the counts from the RNA-seq data, which can be cound in the GEO database here:

1. DESeq2_2023.R reads the counts files and determines the differential expression for each gene
2. run_DE_visualizations_2023.R creates the graphics for the paper from the differential expression data
3. counts2 contains all the couns files from RNA-seq
