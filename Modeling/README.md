This folder contains the code for integrating the RNA-seq data with the metabolic models, performing gene essentiality and identifying genes for mutant experiment.

-persister_open_exchange.ipynb contains the code for processing the gene essentiality and flux sampling data to identify potential gene targets for persisster cells.
-run_riptide_open and run_riptide_open_AP contain the scripts to integrate the transcriptomics data into the iPau21 metabolic mode, generating flux samples and gene essentiality data.
-the submit jobs shell scripts contain the scripts that send all the riptide jobs to the UVA hpc
